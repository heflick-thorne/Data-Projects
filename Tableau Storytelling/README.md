# ðŸ“ˆ Tableau Storytelling: Analyzing Product Return Rates

This project builds upon insights from a prior profitability analysis, with a focused investigation into high product return rates. Using Tableau's storytelling featuresâ€”dashboards and story pointsâ€”I developed a visual narrative to highlight patterns in return behavior and propose potential reasons behind elevated return rates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Identify products and customer segments with unusually high return rates.
- Explore geographic, categorical, and temporal trends related to returns.
- Use visual storytelling to communicate findings and propose data-driven explanations.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques

- **Tableau Dashboards & Story Points** for interactive visualization
- **Data Aggregation** to calculate return rates by dimension (product, region, customer, etc.)
- **Data-Driven Narratives** to explain trends and support decision-making

## ðŸ“Œ Outcome

The final Tableau story provides stakeholders with clear visual evidence of return-related issues and helps inform strategies to reduce returns.
