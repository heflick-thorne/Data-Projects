# Vacation Rental Data Analysis

This project was part of my student coursework to practice **data cleaning and analysis**. I was presented with a set of questions and sub-questions to guide my analysis.

## Research Questions

### 1. Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e., number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?

- Identify the neighborhoods that are most attractive for vacation rentals.
- Determine the property sizes (number of bedrooms) that are most popular.
- Explore whether different neighborhoods have different preferences for property sizes.

### 2. How much money did the most attractive listings generate?

## Methodology

I used a combination of **pivot tables** and **charts** to draw conclusions and provide visual evidence for my findings.
