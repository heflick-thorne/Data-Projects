This project was given to me in my student coursework to practice data cleaning and analysis. 
I was presented the following questions to answer and sub-questions to help guide me analysis

1. Which neighborhoods and property sizes i.e. number of bedrooms are most attractive for vacation rentals?
        The neighborhoods which are most attractive for vacation rentals
        The property sizes (i.e., how many bedrooms) that are most popular for vacation rentals
        If different neighborhoods have different preferences for property sizes
   
2. How much money did the most attractive listings generate?

I used a combination of piviot tables and charts to come to conclusions and show evidence.
