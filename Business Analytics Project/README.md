# E-Commerce User Retention Analysis

Using data provided by an e-commerce company, I was tasked with calculating **user retention**.

## Steps Taken

To make the data usable and actionable, I followed these steps:

1. **Build a conversion funnel**  
   Mapped out the user journey from initial interaction to purchase.

2. **Prepare data for cohort analysis**  
   Grouped users based on their signup date to analyze behavior over time.

3. **Calculate retention rates**  
   Computed the percentage of users returning in subsequent time periods.

4. **Organize and document the spreadsheet**  
   Ensured clarity and reproducibility by clearly labeling data, formulas, and results.
